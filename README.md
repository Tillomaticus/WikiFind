# WikiFind

This is a small project I did to familiarize my self a bit with with React, TypeScript and Vercel. 

Its a small little browser-based game utilizing Wikipedia. The goal is to reach from one random Wikipedia article to another random selected article, purely by clicking links in the articles.

## How to Play:
Go to: https://wiki-find-gamma.vercel.app/


## Tech Stack:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript for static typing
Vite: A next-generation, fast build tool
Tailwind CSS: For quick, customizable, utility-first styling
Vercel: For hosting
